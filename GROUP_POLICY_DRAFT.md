# Group Policies

This document is a [DRAFT]

## Overview

## Purpose/Scope

## Governing structure

Our model for governing structure is Open Governance in order to eliminate single-vendor control over this project and so the group and its projects can be trusted.  The goal is to make our use of this model simple but effective.  This requires clear rules around membership, appropriation rights, and contribution duties.

Why does a project need a governance model?

It is well known that communities that are inclusive and adhere to open governance principles tend to attract the largest following and most vibrant ecosystems.  The risk of abandonment is low.  A lot of open source code is published with an open source license (or not!) but isnâ€™t being actively maintained, and we would like to avoid that.

Open Source, Open Organization or Open Governance?  All.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Failing to give specific responsibilities to people can result in a lack of contributions in a given area of activity. This needs to be balanced against the fact that it is not always possible to instruct members of a community to carry out defined tasks, as they may not be in the employ of the project leaders.

What roles can contributors play in the project?

* Maintainer(s)

## Decisions

Decision making in an open development project appears, at first sight, to be a complex issue and is central to many of the fears examined in the previous section. Many people know, for example, how difficult it can be for a committee to reach a decision. Documenting the process by which decisions are made is therefore a key part of a governance model, and it is worth taking a little time to explore the various approaches commonly taken to prevent deadlock situations from occurring in open development communities.

Decision making in open development projects can range from fully centralized to fully decentralized. Through necessity and familiarity, nearly all projects will start life with a centralized model, with a small number of initial contributors, perhaps as few as one. As a result, all decisions are made by this small team. For a small team, centralizing the decision making is easy, and is akin to what is found in closed projects. However, as a successful project grows, more and more people will be willing to contribute to the objectives of the project. The decision making process may need to evolve accordingly.

Our decision making procedures and processes are:

## Amendments

We rely on GitHub for Organization management and documentation, therefore changes to this and other documentation, procedures and processes shall be amended with discussion there.

## Communications

We typically communicate through Discord and our GitHub Organization repository and it's projects.  A website is also under construction at the time of this writing.  GitHub also serves as our developer mailing list, issue tracker and version control.

## Membership

Membership to The Art of Tech: Not Playing with a Full Tech is free of charge.  

## Intellectual Property

 For our management of intellectual property rights, we will be implementing a CLA, including a developer certificate of origin.

## Contribution process

Notes:
   Some things to ask:

    What roles do project contributors play in this community?
    Are these roles clearly defined or described?
    Are those role definitions or descriptions accessible to everyone working on the project?
    Do these role descriptions also explain how contributors can take on or leave the roles?
