# The Art of Tech: Not Playing with a Full Tech Discord Rules

## About these rules

Inside the The Art of Tech:NPWAFT Discord, We want everyone to have a safe, fun, and enjoyable time in this server, therefore we have put in place a few rules...  

So, before we break down the server rules, everyone here would like to thank you for joining our family. We treat this server & community like our home. This community is a direct result of the type of people we encourage to participate and the rules we keep in place within the community; these rules we ask each and everyone of you to adhere to and follow. Rules listed above are not all the rules as the list would go all the way to the North Pole. So if a rule isnt listed but a mod asks you to stop what you are doing. You need to cease what you are doing thats wrong.

However, violations of the rules may result in a warning, kick, or ban, based on severity and this being said, all Admininstrative decisions are FINAL!

* If you see something against the rules or something that makes you feel unsafe, please message @gbowne1 directly, Staff including an Admin or Mods. We want this server to be a welcoming space!

* This is a friendly community, if you made it here, you already know that more than likely.  

* Don't ignore your warnings or mutes!

* If you have been warned we suggest you make changes to improve your behavior so it doesn’t happen again! And if you’ve been muted please don’t use other accounts to talk in the chat, or other people to talk for you. Wait patiently for your mute to be over.

* Breaking these set of rules will get you a warning.

* Getting 3 warnings will lead to a permanent ban.

* Avoid sending the same message multiple times within the span of a few minutes. This rule includes emoticon spam and letter spam!

* No witch-hunting! Please do not publicly call out people and/or harass them for their misbehavior! If you catch another member breaking the rules, don't take it into your hands, report them privatelty to the Discord server owner @gbowne1 and/or Administrators.

* Just because it's not specifically listed here doesn't mean it's allowed, avoid any drama and negativity for the sake of the community.
  
* We judge each and every situation individually and take action based on the severity and regularity of an offense.

So with that said, Any other actions that cause problems will be dealt with as necessary and breaking these rules will either result in a temporary mute, a kick or a ban. We do not need to justify our selves to you, be nice to the community, respect each other and lets all enjoy our lives

### __PLEASE, NO DRAMA!__

# Our Community & It's Goals  

❤️ This community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. ❤️  

We hope to create an environment in which diverse individuals can collaborate and interact in a positive and affirming way. Examples of behavior that contributes to creating this sort of environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language.
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
* Focusing on what is best for the overall community.
* Showing empathy towards other community members.

Intolerance is not welcome in this community or Discord Server.

It is a goal of this server to have an increasingly diverse membership. That said, personal attacks of any kind will not be tolerated.

Generally speaking, if you’re rude, you’re not welcome here!  Don't be a dick! A bit of banter is fine. But, there is a fine line between banter and being a dick. You will be banned if you are rude or a dick. We are all adults.

Got a cool project or stream you want to share? You’re welcome to in the self-promotion, but no other channels do so long as you have contacted @gbowne1, an Admin or Moderator (if no other staff is presently active)

Put effort in before asking for help!
Most of our members are willing to help.  If someone says that they are willing to help you, they are doing you a favor out of kindness. You need to have at least tried to solve the problem first.  Google and Stackexchange, Stackoverflow, YouTube, etc. are all great resources for help.

If you are learning to code at school/college/university, Please do not ask for code related homework help. Academic dishonesty won’t be tolerated. If it seems like you’re asking people to do your schoolwork for you, that’s an issue.

Specifically Prohibited Content:

1. Begging/asking for financial support, items or jobs.  

2. Excessive Trolling

3. Racially driven statements or 'slurs'.

4. Personal Attacks  

[everyone], If you agree with ALL the information in this channel, please react with a :thumbsup:
