# The Art of Tech: Not Playing with a Full Tech

If you would like to know more about our group please see ABOUT.md

This is the global repository for documentation and the intellectual property for the The Art of Tech: Not Playing with a Full Tech community until the point I can organize together a Github organization.

The Art of Tech: Not Playing with a Full Tech was created originally as a Facebook Group but has grown in to a small community of like minded tech hobbyists and professionals alike.

This repository also contains editor configuration/settings and workspace files for Sublime Text, Visual Studio, VSCode to aid staff in creating group content and other meta files and documentation.

This repository could possibly become a model for other similar social media technology groups who wish to get their meta in order to start.

Note: This repository is not an app.  This is a monorepo used to help the group start working on projects (i.e our website) and for storing group metadata & documentation.
