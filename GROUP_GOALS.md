# Ok in the 25+ weeks since I started this group over on Facebook groups, I have been asked by a few to lay out a few goals for our group. How far we take this group will depend largely on what the member base follows

1) 1k Subscribers to our group Youtube channel then to 2,500.

2) Live Streaming from our group YouTube channel.

3) Create and host a Webdomain, email, website.

4) Host blog

5) Host a Tech Podcast

6) Offer 24/7 tech support in major areas of at least North America, UK/EU, and AU and at least where practical??

7) Create how to videos and/or guides on at least one level, Basic instruction on how to of various subjects.

8) Tech News without all the BS and fluff typical of those creators.

9) More people on our IRC chat on irc.freenode.net #theartoftech so we can have a possible retro chat night. We all remember IRC right? right. (freenode gone)

10) Add a Twitch channel and live streams.

I used to have a IRC based PC tech support group primarily focused on 8, 16 and early 32 bit processor computers pretty much no matter what it was. This was pre-2003. It was successful but IRC died, and a lot of our members lost focus. We can do this again if you're up to it. I have sent emails to everyone I've managed to find the list of old group members.

While in our early days here on the modern Social Media we are off the back of a low subscriber YouTube tech channel. I fully intend on re-creating what was once a very lively thing in our chat room(s)

Let us know what you think or would like We might be pretty far off in membership/subcribership to our various platforms yet to expand too much yet, but we intend on growing while staying reasonably grounded. Also, Let us know if you can help us grow.

Thanks,
Your humble Admin,
GKB

How do we capture group rules.
