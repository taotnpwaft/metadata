## Scope

If you believe you’ve found a security issue in any software, service, or website governed by The Art of Tech: Not Playing with a Full Tech, we encourage you to notify us.

Projects governed by The Art of Tech: Not Playing with a Full Tech sometimes do unsafe things by design (such as a plugin that executes arbitrary code or an option that is dangerous).

This unsafe behavior should be explicitly documented and, if it is, is not
considered a security issue.

There are no hard and fast rules to determine if a bug is worth reporting as a security issue or a “regular” issue. When in doubt, please do send us a report.

## How to submit a report

Security issues can be reported by sending an email to `security@taotnpwaft.org`, which will go to all [core] team members.
The team will acknowledge your email within 48 hours. You will receive a more detailed response within 96 hours.

We will create a maintainer security advisory on GitHub to discuss internally and when needed, invite you to the advisory.
