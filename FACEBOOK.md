The goal of this group is to have a safe place to discuss and share our tech lives, the many, many tech things we do that help us in our lives as well as others.  We are all Windows, Unix and Linux users of various levels who like to share our expertise with others no matter how basic or advanced they are.
This group is for members who are interested in Tech and IT and especially related advice. This group is designed to get you involved in sharing your experiences with the Windows, Linux and Unix operating systems and the apps that run in Linux and Unix or one of its derivatives, and technology in general.
