Thank you for being part of our community. To ensure the best possible experience for all members, we have established some basic guidelines for participation.

By joining and using this community, you agree that you have read and will follow these rules and guidelines. You also agree to reserve discussions and shared files and content to that best suited to this group/forum. This is a great community with which to solicit the advice of your peers, benefit from their experience, and participate in an ongoing conversation.

Questions should be directed to our staff.

Please take a moment to acquaint yourself with these important guidelines. If you have questions, contact an The Art of Tech: Not Playing with a full Tech staff member, moderator or administrator.

In order to preserve a climate that encourages both civil and fruitful dialogue, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate membership in this community for anyone who violate these rules.

## The Rules

Don't challenge or attack others. The discussions and comments are meant to stimulate conversation not to create contention. Let others have their say, just as you may.

Don't post commercial messages on any discussion list, resource library entry, or other area where others might see it. Contact people directly with product and service information if you believe it would help them.

Use caution when discussing products. Information posted on the lists and in the libraries is available for all to see, and comments are subject to libel, slander, and antitrust laws.

All defamatory, abusive, profane, threatening, offensive, or illegal materials are strictly prohibited. Do not post anything that you would not want the world to see or that you would not want anyone to know came from you.

Please note carefully all items listed in the disclaimer and legal rules below, particularly regarding the copyright ownership of information posted.
Remember that other participants have the right to reproduce postings to this site unless you specify otherwise.

Post your message or documents only to the most appropriate sections of our group/forum.
Do not spam several boards with the same message.

All messages must add to the common body of knowledge presented here. We reserve the right to remove and/or reject any message for any reason.

No posting of any personal or corporate information. Please keep this information private. Do not post IP addresses, Phone numbers, or any other form of personal details, be they your own or anyone else's! Please DO NOT put anyone at risk.

All posts that include commercial ads, porn, violence, gambling will be deleted and the user will be banned permanently.

No brand bashing. We all have our favorite brands, and often brands we have a dislike/disdain for. But just because someone shares a different opinion doesn’t make them wrong. So no brand bashing please No Android Vs Apple, etc. etc.
We will NOT tolerate people being berated / mocked for their choice of hardware and/or software. Please bear this in mind when responding to threads. Anyone being derogatory / insulting will be removed from the group

No talk of Warez or other illegal activity
We are a group of professionals, techs, etc and we will not tolerate people asking about Torrents, ISO, Cracks or other illegal software. Anyone breaching this rule will be removed.

## The Art of Tech: Not Playing with a full Tech Community Etiquette

• State concisely and clearly the topic of your comments in the subject line. This allows members to respond more appropriately to your posting and makes it easier for members to search the archives by subject.

• Include only the relevant portions of the original message in your reply. Delete any header information, and put your response before the original posting.

• Only send a message to the entire list when it contains information that everyone can benefit from.

• Send messages such as "thanks for the information" or "me, too" to individuals--not to the entire forum.

• Do not send administrative messages, such as remove me from the forum. Instead, use the web interface to change your settings or to remove yourself. If you are changing e-mail addresses, you do not need to remove yourself from the list and rejoin under your new e-mail address. Simply change your settings.

* Use polite words to ask and answer, do not provoke flamming in the group with harsh words and vilify others.

* Respect others, then others will respect you. We really appreciate someone who is willing to share know.

* If you are asking about networking and server configuration, please tell us what have you done and what problems you encountered. This is because questions without specific data, especially requests for assistance for installation and configuration from basic will be ignored by most members.

* Think before you post! Before posting, please use the search facility. Reposts frustrate everyone, so please try to ensure the content of your post is unique.

* Failure to follow the direct instructions from Admins / Moderators to edit/update your post with correct / relevant information, will result in your [ post / comment ] to be removed, in addition to this you may be muted / blocked (Case Depending).

Failures to create posts like this may result in your post being removed, including other actions if need be.
