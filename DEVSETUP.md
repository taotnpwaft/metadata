# Development Setup Guide

This guide is for the people that would like to contribute to taotnpwaft and do it well.

While we use VSCode and Visual Studio 2019, but you can use whatever IDE you prefer.

Please have a read on [CODESTYLE.md](CODESTYLE.md), any code that does not apply to these rules will not get merged.

## General

This section is for all IDE's not mentioned in this guide.
It's very global, so you might need to take some extra steps to get it to work for you.

1. Fork the [taotnpwaft repository](https://github.com/gbowne1/taotnpwaft).
2. Check out your fork and open it in your favorite IDE.
3. If your favorite IDE is not below, please add your workspace and or project configuration settings to this project.

## Review Process

- [ ]  Review the PR after being allocated to it.
- [ ]  Run code and use it as the end user would. Double check requests in feature’s description.
- [ ]  After exploring feature from your own expectations, review the "QA checklist" created by the feature’s developer in the feature card. Work on whatever hasn’t been covered.
- [ ]  If feature behavior is wrong, don't review code yet. Allocate PR back to developer and describe, in detail, correct feature behavior. Describe meticulously, providing screenshots and flows if applicable. Miscommunication led to misunderstanding, therefore you need to invest time in describing it better now. After explaining the issue again, mention the original issue's author for her/him to know what was done wrong.
- [ ]  Read thoroughly the feature description to check if everything is implemented.
