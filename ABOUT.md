The goal of this group is to have a safe place to discuss and share our tech lives, the many, many tech things we do that help us in our lives as well as others. We are all Windows, Unix and Linux users of various levels who like to share our expertise with others no matter how basic or advanced they are

This group is for members who are interested in Tech and IT and especially related advice. This group is designed to get you involved in sharing your experiences with the Windows, Linux and Unix operating systems and the apps that run in Linux and Unix or one of its derivatives, and technology in general. If new to Linux or Unix, the group can help. This site has been expanded to include all technology-related concepts, not just Linux- and Unix-related technology based

Welcome to the The Art of Tech: Not Playing with a Full Tech Facebook group forum. This is an extension of the Facebook groups conversation / discussion and it is a place to learn, grow, share, educate, mentor, help, etc. At the present we have ~130 members and most of them are active and we are growing. Please bare with us while we get everything set up.

This work has been the result of a 5-10 year plan to bring back my former tech group of 1k - 2k members. I have a number of goals the first of which will be to reach 2k members, but have the largest core of those members be those willing to learn, grow, share, educate, mentor, help, etc.

My premise for creating The Art of Tech: Not Playing with a Full Tech Facebook is because there seems to be somewhat of a gap in social media for tech, IT, Networking people to get together and share without any of the usual cons to posting on a social media platform. Any of us who have spent time in a tech Facebook group, tech reddit such as r/linux, Youtube, instagram, etc. etc. knows that there is plenty of misinformation as well as the 'keyboard warriors'. Most of the Facebook groups you see MEME's, YouTube links, website links, irrelevant posts, SPAM, people who SPAM their non-tech related sites, irrelevant self-promotion, plenty of other useless stuff and not much actual learning, discussion, sharing, growing, educating, mentoring, etc. We allow the beginners to share their questions as well as allowing the pros to share their knowledge, advice without fear of the normal things that may happen when one posts to a social media outlet such at the above.

If anyone knows of such activity of those things on this group, report them and they will be removed/banned.

We also have IRC and Discord available for chat and we plan on adding more platforms.

I will post the group links and rules as they are created officially.
Thanks so very much and enjoy the group!

This eventually should be the content posted to the About page on our website (and/or) any other platform.
