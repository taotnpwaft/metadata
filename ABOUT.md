# About

## Who (Who are we?)

This is a tech community with hobbyists and professionals with everything from coders to admin to homelabbers to osdev and other IT people where we can learn, educate, grow, share, mentor and help each other and have fun engaging chats as well.

We are also a small but growing social media based tech organization.  Our organization is also a small business in the US, called  The Art of Tech: Not Playing with a Full Tech, LLC. created  solely for the purpose of being able to accept donations of various types and sources, and is set up as a media organization.

The core of our membership are volunteers and contributors. as those willing to learn, grow, share, educate, mentor, help, etc. others in the tech fields and as hobbyists.

## What (What do we do?)

We:

- Chat in Discord
- Stream on Twitch
- Make tech related content on YouTube

## When (History)

We started as a small group of regular commenters and participants of a YouTube tech channel when he did Live Streams on his channel.  I then created this group so we could have more interaction, as a Facebook Groups group called The Art of Tech: Not Playing with a Full Tech. This process was started in 2018 and 2019 by asking these persons if they would like to join a small tech group.

## Where (where are we based?)

We are based in the United States of America.

## Why (Purpose & Goals)

My premise for creating The Art of Tech: Not Playing with a Full Tech  is because there seems to be somewhat of a gap in social media for tech, IT, Networking people to get together and share without any of the usual cons to posting on a social media platform. Any of us who have spent time in a tech Facebook group, tech reddit such as r/linux, Youtube, instagram, etc. etc. knows that there is plenty of misinformation as well as the 'keyboard warriors'. Most of the Facebook groups you see MEME's, YouTube links, website links, irrelevant posts, SPAM, people who SPAM their non-tech related sites, irrelevant self-promotion, plenty of other useless stuff and not much actual learning, discussion, sharing, growing, educating, mentoring, etc. We allow the beginners to share their questions as well as allowing the pros to share their knowledge, advice without fear of the normal things that may happen when one posts to a social media outlet such at the above.

It is designed to get you involved in sharing your experiences with the Windows, Mac, Linux and Unix operating systems.

## Our Mission

To offer a secure environment where tech enthusiasts may get together, talk, and learn from one another as well as teach others, particularly those with mental health challenges.

To provide a safe place for users that enjoy tech to gather and communicate and to learn and share knowledge and teach others tech skills especially those with mental health issues.

## Our Goals

The goal of this group is to have a safe place to discuss and share our tech lives, the many, many tech things we do that help us in our lives as well as others. We are all Windows, Unix and Linux users of various levels who like to share our expertise with others no matter how basic or advanced they are.
